# CoddingChallenge

United Remote's Coding Challenge:

Project architecture : 

MySQL <=> Hibernate ORM <=> DAO(JPA) <=>  Struts2 Action <=> Struts2 Dispatcher <=> JSP Pages

Developed using Netbeans IDE 8.2 / Glassfish Server 4.1.1

How to properly reuse project after cloning : 

Reconfigure Persistence.xml to match your MySQL configuration.

Run the file TestDAL.java (Source Packages-> com.cc.dal-> TestDAL.java) which will generate the database and the tables w/ some shops.

Launch the app - Sign Up - You're ready to go.

PN : Version Control : I had some problems with a previous repository so I had to delete it and commit again. So previous versions were deleted with the commits's comments
